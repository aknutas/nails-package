# Summary

NAILS performs statistical and Social Network Analysis (SNA) on citation data. SNA is a new way for researchers to map large datasets and get insights from new angles by analyzing connections between articles. As the amount of publications grows on any given field [1], automatic tools for this sort of analysis are becoming increasingly important prior to starting research on new fields. NAILS also provides useful data when performing Systematic Mapping Studies (SMS) in scientific literature. A systematic mapping study [2] is a secondary study that aims at classification and thematic analysis of earlier research. The SMS is more general in search terms and aims at classifying and structuring the field of research, while the target of systematic literature review is to summarise and evaluate the research results. According to Kitchenham et al. [3] performing a SMS can be especially suitable if few literature reviews have been done on the topic and there is a need to get a general overview of the field of interest. Both kinds of studies can be used to identify research gaps in the current state of research.

In this paper we present the literature analysis tool NAILS, which uses a series of custom statistical and network analysis functions to give the user an overview of literature datasets. The features can be divided into two primary sections: Firstly, statistical analysis, which for example gives an overview of publication frequencies, most published authors and journals. Secondly, the more novel network analysis, which gives further insight into relationship between the interlinked citations and cooperation between authors. For example, the most basic features can use citation network analysis identify the most cited authors and publication forums. Advanced features support mapping researcher cooperation and citation networks, and finding the core publications in the examined field of science. The toolâ€™s source code is freely available in Github, an open source code repository, and the web-based interface can also be accessed from the [project page] (http://aknutas.github.io/nails/).

You can download, install and use our R package by installing it with the [install_github](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/devtools/versions/1.12.0/topics/install_github) function from the R [devtools package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html). See further use instructions in the [README](https://github.com/aknutas/nails-package/blob/master/README.md) or in our R package documentation (to be added once complete).

Our software depends on splitstackshape[4], reshape[5], plyr[6], stringr[7], tm[8], SnowballC[9], lda[10], LDAvis[11], igraph[12], knitr[13] and markdown[14]. The stm[15] package is used to calculate the number of topics for topicmodeling. When installing the nails package, proper versions should be downloaded and installed automatically as dependencies.

Alternatively you can upload files to our online analysis server. You can view a brief [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/I1bRXQs_zMk?list=PLJiFJenPKrLOpdu7E1gEhVEAWF7CLQs_2) on how to get started.
