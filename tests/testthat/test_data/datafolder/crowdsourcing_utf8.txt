Web-based collaborations and cross-organizational processes typically require dynamic and context-based interactions between people and services. However, finding the right partner to work on joint tasks or to solve emerging problems in such scenarios is challenging due to scale and temporary nature of collaborations. Furthermore, actor competencies evolve over time, thus requiring dynamic approaches for their management. Web services and SOA are the ideal technical framework to automate interactions spanning people and services. To support such complex interaction scenarios, we discuss mixed service-oriented systems that are composed of both humans and software services, interacting to perform certain activities. As an example, consider a professional online support community consisting of interactions between human participants and software-based services. We argue that trust between members is essential for successful collaborations. Unlike a security perspective, we focus on the notion of social trust in collaborative networks. We show an interpretative rule-based approach to enable humans and services to establish trust based on interactions and experiences, considering their context and subjective perceptions.

While traditional mapping is nearly exclusively coordinated and often also carried out by large organisations, crowdsourcing geospatial data refers to generating a map using informal social networks and web 2.0 technology. Key differences are the fact that users lacking formal training in map making create the geospatial data themselves rather than relying on professional services; that potentially very large user groups collaborate voluntarily and often without financial compensation with the result that at a very low monetary cost open datasets become available and that mapping and change detection occur in real time. This situation is similar to that found in the Open Source software environment. We shortly explain the basic technology needed for crowdsourcing geospatial data, discuss the underlying concepts including quality issues and give some examples for this novel way of generating geospatial data. We also point at applications where alternatives do not exist such as life traffic information systems. Finally we explore the future of crowdsourcing geospatial data and give some concluding remarks. (C) 2010 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

Perceived user experience is largely determined by the frequency, duration and severity of network events that impact a service. While today's networks implement sophisticated infrastructure that issues alarms for most failures, there remains a class of silent outages (e. g., caused by configuration errors) that are not detected. Further, existing alarms provide little information to help operators understand the impact of network events on services. Attempts to address this through infrastructure that monitors end-to-end performance for customers have been hampered by the cost of deployment and by the volume of data generated by these solutions. We present an alternative approach that pushes monitoring to applications on end systems and uses their collective view to detect network events and their impact on services - an approach we call Crowdsourcing Event Monitoring (CEM). This paper presents a general framework for CEM systems and demonstrates its effectiveness for a P2P application using a large dataset gathered from BitTorrent users and confirmed network events from two ISPs. We discuss how we designed and deployed a prototype CEM implementation as an extension to BitTorrent. This system performs online service-level network event detection through passive monitoring and correlation of performance in end-users' applications.

Putting the crowd to work in a knowledge-based factory	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Crowdsourcing; Machine learning; Geometric reasoning; Canonical views; Shape similarity; 2D nesting	DESIGN; MODELS; PARTS; REUSE	Although researchers have developed numerous computational approaches to reasoning and knowledge representation, their implementations are always limited to specific applications (e.g assembly planning, fault diagnosis or production scheduling) for which bespoke knowledge bases or algorithms have been created However, "cloud computing" has made irrelevant both the physical location and internal processes used by machine intelligence In other words, the Internet encourages functional processes to be treated as 'black boxes' with which users need only be concerned with posing the right question and interpreting the response The system asking the questions does not need to know how answers are generated, only that they are available in an appropriate time frame This paper proposes that Crowdsourcing could provide on-line, 'black-box', reasoning capabilities that could far exceed the capabilities of current Al technologies (re genetic algorithms, neural-nets, case-based reasoning) in terms of flexibility and scope. This paper describes how Crowdsourcing has been deployed in three different reasoning scenarios to carry out industrial tasks that involve significant amounts of tacit (e.g unformalised) knowledge. The first study reports the application of Crowdsourcing to identify canonical view of 3D CAD models. The qualitative results suggest that the anonymous, Internet, workforce have a good comprehension of 3D geometry Having established this basic competence the second experiment assesses the Crowd's ability to judge the similarity of 3D components Comparison of the results with published benchmarks shows a high degree of correspondence Lastly the performance of the Internet labourers is quantified in a 2D nesting task, where their performance is found to be superior to reported computational algorithms In all these cases results were returned within a couple of hours and the paper concludes that there is potential for broad application of Crowdsourcing to geometric problem solving in CAD/CAM.

Five distinct groups of humans would interact through Visipedia: users, experts, editors, visual workers, and machine vision scientists. The latter would gradually build automata able to interpret images. I explore some of the technical challenges involved in making Visipedia happen. I argue that Visipedia will likely grow organically, combining state-of-the-art machine vision with human labor.

We thus introduce friendsourcing, a form of crowdsourcing aimed at collecting accurate information available only to a small, socially-connected group of individuals. Our approach to friendsourcing is to design socially enjoyable interactions that produce the desired information as a side effect. We focus our analysis around Collabio, a novel social tagging game that we developed to encourage friends to tag one another within an online social network. Collabio encourages friends, family, and colleagues to generate useful information about each other. We describe the design space of incentives in social tagging games and evaluate our choices by a combination of usage log analysis and survey data. Data acquired via Collabio is typically accurate and augments tags that could have been found on Facebook or the Web. To complete the arc from data collection to application, we produce a trio of prototype applications to demonstrate how Collabio tags could be utilized: an aggregate tag cloud visualization, a personalized RSS feed, and a question and answer system. The social data powering these applications enables them to address needs previously difficult to support, such as question answering for topics comprehensible only to a few of a user's friends.

We first take a look at how personal genomics services, exemplified by the company 23andMe, communicate information on drug response to customers. We then discuss the most important benefits and issues we see arising with the idea of 'crowdsourcing' pharmacogenomics research via commercial genome-scan providers. We conclude with a brief vision for the future.

Instead, we can collect subjective (possibly noisy) labels from multiple experts or annotators. In practice, there is a substantial amount of disagreement among the annotators, and hence it is of great practical interest to address conventional supervised learning problems in this scenario. In this paper we describe a probabilistic approach for supervised learning when we have multiple annotators providing (possibly noisy) labels but no absolute gold standard. The proposed algorithm evaluates the different experts and also gives an estimate of the actual hidden labels. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is superior to the commonly used majority voting baseline.

Managing it right means understanding that even though the new platforms are all about harnessing crowds and communities, in the end those crowds and communities are nothing but a sum of individuals. And your company's social web efforts will succeed only to the extent that you are able to attract good individuals, motivate them to perform good work, and empower them to get to know and trust one another enough to collaborate toward the end goals of the community. The question is, How do you do that? The answer: by capitalizing on the motivational power of in reputation - that is, by designing and building an online reputation system that triggers and nourishes the kind of web community that will serve your company's needs. Using examples such as Amazon, eBay, Epinions and Yelp, the author describes how design choices of a reputation system can profoundly affect a community's culture, making an otherwise collaborative and cordial community into a competitive and even combative space.

Internet users normalize text displayed in a web interface, thereby providing a parallel corpus of normalized and non-normalized text. With this corpus, SMT models are generated to translate non-normalized into normalized text. To build traditional language-specific text normalization systems, knowledge of linguistics as well as established computer skills to implement text normalization rules are required. Our systems are built without profound computer knowledge due to the simple self-explanatory user interface and the automatic generation of the SMT models. Additionally, no inhouse knowledge of the language to normalize is required due to the multilingual expertise of the internet community. All techniques are applied on French texts, crawled with our Rapid Language Adaptation Toolkit [1] and compared through Levenshtein edit distance [2], BLEU score [3], and perplexity.

As a representative dictionary, we selected Wiktionary [1] since it is at hand in multiple languages and, in addition to the definitions of the words, many phonetic notations in terms of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) are available. Given word lists in four languages English, French, German, and Spanish, we calculated the percentage of words with phonetic notations in Wiktionary. Furthermore, two quality checks were performed: First, we compared pronunciations from Wiktionary to pronunciations from dictionaries based on the Global Phone project, which had been created in a rule-based fashion and were manually cross-checked [2]. Second, we analyzed the impact of Wiktionary pronunciations on automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. French Wiktionary achieved the best pronunciation coverage, containing 92.58% phonetic notations for the French Global Phone word list as well as 76.12% and 30.16% for country and international city names. In our ASR systems evaluation, the Spanish system gained the most improvement from Wiktionary pronunciations with 7.22% relative word error rate reduction.

Representing uncertainty on the semantic web is becoming increasingly common, using fuzzy ontologies and other techniques. Very large ontologies and vocabularies have been created, however users may find it difficult to select the correct concept or term when there are large numbers of items that on face value appear to represent the same idea. Creating subsets of ontologies is a popular approach to solving this problem but this may not fit well with the need to deal with complex domains. However crowdsourcing techniques, which harness the power of large groups, may be more effective than document analysis or expert opinion. In Crowdsourcing, large numbers of people collaborate by performing relatively simple tasks usually using applications distributed via the World Wide Web. This approach is being tested in the medical domain using a very large clinical vocabulary, SNOMED CT.

Recently we observe the emergence of authors who follow a different approach, taping the wisdom of crowds as key resource of their own publications. In this paper, we explore business model innovation which leverages value propositions of textbooks by applying crowdsourcing. We use case study research methods to analyze four textbooks written collaboratively. Essential findings indicate occurrence of user-communities fulfilling peer-reviewing, editing or co-authoring despite a lack of monetary incentives. We further detect a tendency towards wiki software providing a community hub. This paper enters the field of partially crowdsourced textbooks and derives future questions of research.

Metacycle is a web 2.0 project (please visit www.Metacycle.ca for details), which aims to allow designers, and also the general public, to share their creative ideas about the possibility of giving a second life to obsolete products. The general objective behind this project is to limit the negative environmental impacts created by the discarding of objects that we use on a daily basis, such as electronic devices, sports equipment, toys, etc. More and more of these devices and objects have reduced life spans. This is partly due to technical evolution, but also due to other factors such as aesthetic obsolescence, difficulty in repairing or simply loss of interest (Chapman, 2005). A majority of those technically advanced and sophisticated products end up in landfills after a short time, as they are usually not recyclable. This model of production and consumption is obviously not sustainable. How can designers affect a positive change to this negative scenario? Can we propose an alternative? It is with these questions in mind that a group of design researchers from two Montreal universities have oriented their research with the objective of proposing new avenues to the current model. Their research, entitled Metacycle, proposes an interactive web site that exploits the creative potential of a concept known as "crowdsourcing"(Howe, 2006). The implementation of this project has been made possible through the collaboration of a number of design schools, which have accepted to participate in the beta version of Metacycle and who were willing to test and evaluate the interface of the web site.

This article introduces a language-independent, semi-automatic and endogenous method for enriching lexical resources, based on collaborative editing and random walks through existing lexical relationships, and shows how this approach enables us to overcome recurrent impediments. It compares the impact of using different data sources and similarity measures on the task of improving synonymy networks. Finally, it defines an architecture for applying the presented method to Wiktionary and explains how it has been implemented.

With its low cost and scalability; crowdsourcing presents an attractive option for evaluating the large design space of visualizations; however, it first requires validation. In this paper, we assess the viability of Amazon's Mechanical Turk as a platform for graphical perception experiments. We replicate previous studies of spatial encoding and luminance contrast and compare our results. We also conduct new experiments on rectangular area perception (as in treemaps or cartograms) and on chart size and gridline spacing. Our results demonstrate that crowdsourced perception experiments are viable and contribute new insights for visualization design. Lastly, we report cost and performance data from our experiments and distill recommendations for the design of crowdsourced studies.

We sought an easily implementable method to disqualify those people who participate but don't take the study tasks seriously. By using two previously pilot tested screening questions, we identified 764 of 1,962 people who did not answer conscientiously. Young men seem to be most likely to fail the qualification task. Those that are professionals, students, and non-workers seem to be more likely to take the task seriously than financial workers, hourly workers, and other workers. Men over 30 and women were more likely to answer seriously.

Crowdsourcing of these essential manual tasks is a good option, provided one can take care of some key challenges, so that the quality level expected by the customer is met. We show how tools for efficient validation and correction are adapted and enhanced to address issues associated with crowdsourcing, such as data privacy, quality control, crowd monitoring, and job quality assurance. We started to implement these ideas and technologies in our COoperative eNgine for Correction of ExtRacted Text (CONCERT), which is used in book digitization projects.

Our research team is focused in bringing this approach closer to the European culture, more specifically the cultural factors underlying the dynamics and motivation of communities available to solve the innovation challenges of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), that we call Crowdsourcing Innovation. We believe that, due to the common lack of resources for innovation in these companies, a service capable of involving them in large networks filled with useful and reachable knowledge, and capable of supporting these companies through all the innovation process, is crucial to the future competitiveness of the European SMEs. Although our team is focusing on several aspects related to Crowdsourcing, my main research focuses the information services and supporting applications to create a web platform adapted to the key economical, organizational, legal and cultural differences that make current Crowdsourcing Innovation businesses less popular among European SMEs than in North America.

Unfortunately, current development models offer little help in understanding and managing this new form of value co-creation. The Metropolis Model has recently identified three realms of roles for crowdsourcing: the kernel (providing the core functionality), the periphery (the partners) and the masses (the end users). Technically wise, the periphery requires mechanisms for the commons to suggest, develop and maintain additional services on top of the kernel. This work concretizes the Metropolis Model for crowdsourced website development based on user scripts. We outline some technical challenges to foster the relationship between end users (the masses), scripters (the periphery) and the web site (the kernel) on the way to promote script-based crowdsourcing.

Because of the limited control over that workforce, it is challenging to ensure the quality of the work results. Several approaches have been proposed that can be applied to specific types of HITs. However, it is difficult to identify a suitable quality management approach for any given type of HIT. This paper aims to provide a first sketch of a decision matrix.

However, designing a knowledge network about our cities is an arduous task, given that data sensed cannot be used directly, human significance must be added. Adding human significance can be achieved via an automated "expert system (ES)" in which domain expert knowledge are stored in a knowledge-based repository. The domain expert knowledge is matched with the corresponding data to derive specific inference which can aid decision making for urban stakeholders. This requires amalgamation of various interdisciplinary techniques. This paper presents a survey of existing technologies in order to investigate the emerging issues surrounding the design of a live knowledge network for sustainable urban living. The maps and models of the existing infrastructure of our cities that include a wealth of information such as topography, layout, zoning, land use, transportation networks, public facilities, and resource network grids need to be integrated with real-time spatiotemporal information about the city. Public data in forms of archives and data streams as well as online data from the social network and the Web can be analyzed using data mining techniques. The domain experts need to interpret the results of data mining into knowledge that will augment the existing knowledge base and models of our cities. In addition to the analysis of archived and streamed data sources from the built environment, the emerging state-of-the-art Web 2.0 and mobile technologies are presented as the potential techniques to crowddesign a live urban knowledge network. Data modeling, data mining, crowdsourcing, and social intervention techniques are reviewed in this paper with examples from the related work and our own experiments.

With the availability of news content via online syndicated feeds, it is now possible to automate some aspects of this process. There is also great potential to crowdsource(2) much of the annotation work that is required to train a machine learning system to perform sentiment scoring. We describe such a system for tracking economic sentiment in online media that has been deployed since August 2009. It uses annotations provided by a cohort of non-expert annotators to train a learning system to classify a large body of news items. We report on the design challenges addressed in managing the effort of the annotators and in making annotation an interesting experience.

Chem Spider: Integrating Structure-Based Resources Distributed across the Internet	ENHANCING LEARNING WITH ONLINE RESOURCES, SOCIAL NETWORKING, AND DIGITAL LIBRARIES	ACS Symposium Series		English	Article; Book Chapter							ACCESS CHEMISTRY DATABASES	Accessing information about chemicals distributed across the Internet is, in many ways, too easy. Chemists simply type in the name of a chemical of interest into a search engine and then wade through the results hoping to find a result matching their query. Such approaches are limited to the whims of text-based matching and it can be very time-consuming to wade through pages of results attempting to segregate the various types of information retrieved. ChemSpider is a free online structure database developed with the intention of aggregating and linking chemical structure based information and data across the Internet. Containing almost 25 million unique chemical entities and linked out to over 300 data sources ChemSpider offers the ability to perform both text and structure-based searches to resource information such as chemical vendors, properties, analytical data, patents, publications and a myriad of other information. While enabling this broad form of searching for chemical data across the Internet ChemSpider has also assumed a key role in allowing the community to expand and improve the online data by providing a platform for community deposition, annotation and curation. As a result the ChemSpider Web site has become a crowdsourcing environment for chemists to expose their own activities to the community and participate in creating the richest single resource for chemistry related information available online and, in keeping with the nature of the Web, for free.

Investigating the Concept of Consumers as Producers in Virtual Worlds: Looking through Social, Technical, Economic, and Legal Lenses	FACETS OF VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS	Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Facets of Virtual Environments	JUL 27-29, 2009	Berlin, GERMANY			consumers as producers; prosumer; crowdsourcing; virtual worlds; emergent behavior; architecture		Virtual worlds such as World of Warcraft and Second Life enable consumers as producers, that is users can choose to be passive consumers of content, active producers of content, or both. Consumers as producers poses unique challenges and opportunities for both operators and users of virtual worlds. While the degrees of freedom for user-generated content differ depending on the world, instances of consumers as producers can be found in many virtual worlds. In this paper we characterize consumers as producers with the help of four "lenses"-social, technical, economic, and legal-and use the lenses to discuss implications for operators and users. These lenses provide a complementary analysis of consumers as producers from different angels and shows that an understanding of it requires a holistic approach.

While dealing with novel objects is a largely unsolved challenge in AI, it is easy for people. In this paper we present a framework for robot supervision through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Unlike traditional models of teleoperation, people provide semantic information about the world and subjective judgements. The robot then autonomously utilizes the additional information to enhance its capabilities. The information can be collected on demand in large volumes and at low cost. We demonstrate our approach on the task of grasping unknown objects.

MOVING THE CROWD AT THREADLESS Motivations for participation in a crowdsourcing application	INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY			English	Article						crowdsourcing; motivations; instant messaging interviews; online community; addiction	OPEN-SOURCE PROJECTS; SOFTWARE	Crowdsourcing is an online, distributed problem-solving and production model already in use by businesses such as Threadless. com, iStockphoto. com, and InnoCentive.com. This model, which harnesses the collective intelligence of a crowd of Web users through an open-call format, has the potential for government and non-profit applications. Yet, in order to explore new applications for the crowdsourcing model, there must be a better understanding of why crowds participate in crowdsourcing processes. Based on 17 interviews conducted via instant messenger with members of the crowd at Threadless, the present study adds qualitatively rich data on a new crowdsourcing case to an existing body of quantitative data on motivations for participation in crowdsourcing. Four primary motivators for participation at Threadless emerge from these interview data: the opportunity to make money, the opportunity to develop one's creative skills, the potential to take up freelance work, and the love of community at Threadless. A fifth theme is also discussed that addresses the language of 'addiction' used by the interviewees to describe their activity on the site. Understanding this kind of 'addiction' in an online community is perhaps the most important finding for future public crowdsourcing ventures. This study develops a more complete - though ongoing - composite of what motivates the crowd to participate in crowdsourcing applications generally, information crucial to adapt the crowdsourcing model to new forms of problem-solving.

Geographic information created by amateur citizens, often known as volunteered geographic information, has recently provided an interesting alternative to traditional authoritative information from mapping agencies and corporations, and several recent papers have provided the beginnings of a literature on the more fundamental issues raised by this new source. Data quality is a major concern, since volunteered information is asserted and carries none of the assurances that lead to trust in officially created data. During emergencies time is the essence, and the risks associated with volunteered information are often outweighed by the benefits of its use. An example is discussed using the four wildfires that impacted the Santa Barbara area in 2007-2009, and lessons are drawn.	[Goodchild, Michael F.; Glennon, J.

Web 2.0 provides the technological foundations upon which the crowdsourcing paradigm evolves and operates, enabling networked experts to work collaboratively to complete a specific task. Enterprise crowdsourcing poses interesting challenges for both academic and industrial research along the social, legal, and technological dimensions. In this paper we describe the challenges that researchers and practitioners face when thinking about various aspects of enterprise crowdsourcing. First, to establish technological foundations, what are the interaction models and protocols between the Enterprise and the crowd. Secondly, how is crowdsourcing going to face the challenges in quality assurance, enabling Enterprises to optimally leverage the scalable workforce. Thirdly, what are the novel (Web) applications enabled by Enterprise crowdsourcing.

We examine the use of untrained human volunteers from Amazons Mechanical Turk in disambiguating prepositional phrase (PP) attachment over sentences drawn from the Wall Street Journal corpus. Our goal is to compare the performance of these crowdsourced judgments to the annotations supplied by trained linguists for the Penn Treebank project in order to indicate the viability of this approach for annotation projects that involve contextual disambiguation. The results of our experiments on a sample of the Wall Street Journal corpus show that invoking majority agreement between multiple human workers can yield PP attachments with fairly high precision. This confirms that a crowdsourcing approach to syntactic annotation holds promise for the generation of training corpora in new domains and genres where high-quality annotations are not available and difficult to obtain.

This method is capable of accessing and aggregating certain organizational information that has previously not been attainable via traditional methods such as surveys, polls, group meetings, or suggestion boxes. Such information is often of great tactical and/or strategic value. Existing in-house prediction markets, which are either opened to all members of the organization or to pre-selected groups of experts within the organization, base participant's power to influence the market strictly on the amount of their assets (usually in mock currency). We propose a more nuanced design approach that considers additional factors for determining the participant's influence on the market over the long term. The goal of this design approach is to improve the accuracy and decision-support viability of in-house prediction markets.

Evidence would suggest that the penetration and demographic spread of the adoption of SM continues to grow rapidly within our daily life, not only on a personal level, but also in the workplace. However, there is a lack of research relating to SM and its application within specific business areas. Firstly, this paper intends to focus on the utilisation of SM to foster Knowledge Management (KM) potential within organisations. Anecdotally, an important concern of decision makers is the reputational risk and threat to traditional models of Intellectual Property management posed by the use of SM in the workplace. In addition, there is a perception that the business use of social networking websites is "time wasting" and not cost-effective, considering the perceived resource requirements to manage and successfully exploit the phenomenon of SM. However, within organisations, there are a range of stakeholders that could potentially play an important role in influencing decision makers' views in terms of limiting the risk and gaining the business opportunities which SM offers. The authors believe that SM can offer tremendous benefits and opportunities for knowledge-aware management, including new knowledge creation, fresh approaches to Intellectual Property generation and innovation, and the development of valuable and deep insights into client and customer perception. Each of the aforementioned opportunities may result in commercial benefits and advantages. But, in the absence of clear and compelling models for the application and exploitation of SM, the uptake of these tools could remain patchy, and the potential for KM practitioners to influence decision makers, regarding focusing on the positive side of the risk/opportunity equation, will be challenging. Secondly, the result of this paper is to improve the understanding of businesses perception and adoption of SM and the role of KM in that. The authors devised a survey that sought to capture the scope and nature of the use of SM in a business context, the application areas of work to which it is being applied, the key champions for the use of SM and the key constraints and guidance on its use. In particular, the authors aimed to gain insight into an organisation's perspectives regarding the opportunities and threats offered by SM for the generation of Intellectual Assets and especially of new knowledge. The intent was to gain an "as is" view and identify commonalities that have resulted in a positive perception of SM. The paper presents the findings of this survey, identifying the key applications of SM, where it is implemented and utilised, the prevailing attitudes and the key influencer for decision makers. In addition, the results specifically intend to demonstrate the active or passive role of the KM community in the wider business application of SM, highlighting areas where the authors believe opportunity exists for KM practitioners to influence decisions through a more extensive use of SM.								*AIIM, 2010, AIIM FIND CONTR OPT; DYSART J, 2008, INFORM TODAY MEDFORD, V25, P32; EMERALD PUBLISHING, 2009, STRATEGIC DIRECTION, V25, P20; Firestone J.

Due to a low average fertility rate of 1.5 births per women each generation is smaller than its previous one. On the other hand, increased life expectancy results in an aging society. Therefore, the population is not only shrinking but also aging, which has direct influence on the composition of companies' workforce. Companies are confronted with the loss of resources and knowledge base due to the increasing number of retiring employees. In our ongoing research work, we address this problem and focus on leveraging the competencies, skills and resources of retired employees. We adapt existing social media and Web 2.0 functionalities such as social networking and crowdsourcing to the needs of retired people and provide the prototype software platform EMPOWER that builds on top of established enterprise software, specifically human resource management systems. The approach pursued with EMPOWER can be roughly split into the following three major steps. Firstly, we provide means to manage basic profile data of pensioners. Today, most companies maintain the master data of their employees in HR systems. After retirement, the data of pensioners has to be extracted from the human resource information system (HRIS), formatted and provided that the retiree can maintain its profile in an external self-service. Therefore, legal and security aspects have to be considered. Secondly, we facilitate the establishment of social alumni networks, which can generate benefits for both parties: On the one hand former employees can be connected to their ex-colleagues and the company. In addition, if alumni networks are supported with modern social media tools, there also remains the possibility of forming special forums of interest among the participants, which allows the alumni to broaden their horizon in a specialist area. On the other hand - from the perspective of the company - through such networks alumni remain a potential supplier of knowledge and innovation. Their expertise, ideas and suggestions of improvements on alumni network forums may provide valuable input for the development, manufacturing as well as sales & marketing of the company's products. Thirdly, it is reasonable to us to provide a private enterprise crowdsourcing platform on top. This facilitates participants not only to communicate with each other via forums, but also to undertake tasks which are assigned by the company for some kind of benefits. Especially, on such platforms companies can outsource tasks to the retired employee community, where participants can provide information on their interests and competence. Anyone of the retirees in the community who is interested in completing a task for the company can register with the platform and submit a solution.

A novel solution is proposed in this paper, based on a knowledge service approach to support knowledge-base innovation. Knowledge services provide an ICT-enabled open accessible environment for on-demand knowledge acquisition. The BOKs-based rich knowledge resources repository supports one-stop service for innovation across multiple domains. Innovation knowledge services are also provided as an innovative guide and tools for knowledge workers, innovation champions and CxOs being involved in innovation activities, including innovation management, innovation methods, entrepreneurship, new product development etc. Innovation services are required to cover all level of DIKW framework (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) to avoid loss anything in lower level. Besides the resource layer, a networking layer is provided for building CoPs and CoIs for collaborative learning and innovation. It is an open innovation platform in which solution seekers can post their issue to find wisdom of crowds and the system provides online assistance for solvers and ideas searching. Then a collaborative innovation network can be formed dependent on attributes of the problem issue. It can either be a volunteer-based community just motivated with a common interest, or a bidding-based knowledge marketplace for crowdsourcing. Knowledge services are looked as a principle infrastructure to promote intellectual capital and continuous innovation in knowledge economy. A pilot development project is underway and has made significant progress. At Shanghai we have collected and developed a set of BOKs in innovation, software engineering, IT, and modern services domains, including New Product Development BOK, CTO BOK and CIO certificate program etc.			asti-gm@online.sh.cn; bjshen@sjtu.edu.cn					Anand N, 2007, ACAD MANAGE J, V50, P406; Chesbrough H.

In this paper, we analyze a recent experience in which CrowdFlower conducted crowdsourced translation, categorization and geo-tagging for SMS-based reporting as part of Mission 4636 after a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti on January 12, 2010. We discuss CrowdFlower's approach to this task, lessons learned from the experience, and opportunities to generalize the techniques and technologies involved for other ICT for development (ICTD) applications. We find that CrowdFlower's most significant contribution to Mission 4636 and to the broader field of crowdsourced crisis relief lies in the flexible, scalable nature of the pool of earthquake survivors, volunteers, workers, and machines that the organization engaged during the emergency response efforts.

A Method of Training on Samples and Clustering on Teachers	PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWENTY-FOURTH AAAI CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AAAI-10)			English	Proceedings Paper	24th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)	JUL 11-15, 2010	Atlanta, GA	Assoc Advancement Artificial Intelligence				As the Internet-based crowdsourcing services become more and more popular, learning from multiple teachers or sources has received more attention of the researchers in the machine learning area. In this setting, the learning system is dealing with samples and labels provided by multiple teachers, who in common cases, are non-expert. Their labeling styles and behaviors are usually diverse, some of which are even detrimental to the learning system. Thus, simply putting them together and utilizing the algorithms designed for single-teacher scenario would be not only improper, but also damaging. The problem calls for more specific methods. Our work focuses on a case where the teachers are composed of good ones and irresponsible ones. By irresponsible, we mean the teacher who takes the labeling task not seriously and label the sample at random without inspecting the sample itself. This behavior is quite common when the task is not attractive enough and the teacher just wants to finish it as soon as possible. Sometimes, the irresponsible teachers could take a considerable part among all the teachers. If we do not take out their effects, our learning system would be ruined with no doubt. In this paper, we propose a method for picking out the good teachers with promising experimental results. It works even when the irresponsible teachers are dominating in numbers.

However, researchers have not been certain about its reliability. In a series of experiments, this paper compares data collected via Mechanical Turk to those obtained using more traditional methods One set of experiments measured the predictability of words in sentences using the Cloze sentence completion task (Taylor, 1953). The correlation between traditional and Turk Cloze scores is high (rho=0.823) and both data sets perform similarly against alternative measures of contextual predictability. Five other experiments on the semantic relatedness of verbs and phrasal verbs (how much is "lift" part of "lift up") manipulate the presence of the sentence context and the composition of the experimental list. The results indicate that Turk data correlate well between experiments and with data from traditional methods (rho up to 0.9), and they show high inter-rater consistency and agreement. We conclude that Mechanical Turk is a reliable source of data for complex linguistic tasks in heavy use by psycholinguists.

First, an integrated computational method is employed to extract the ontological structures from folksonomies. It exploits the power of low support association rule mining supplemented by an upper ontology such as Word Net. Promising results have been obtained from experiments using tag datasets from Flickr and Citeulike. Next; a crowdsourcing method is introduced to channel online users' search efforts to help evolve the extracted ontology.

Research has shown that multiple redundant results delivered by different workers can be aggregated in order to achieve a reliable result. However, existing implementations of this approach are rather inefficient as they multiply the effort for task execution and are not able to guarantee a certain quality level. As a, starting point towards an integrated approach for quality management of people services we have developed a quality management model that combines elements of statistical quality control (SQC) with group decision theory. The contributions of the workers are tracked and weighted individually in order to minimize the quality management effort while guaranteing a well-defined level of overall result quality. A quantitative analysis of the approach based on an optical character recognition (OCR) scenario confirms the efficiency and reach of the approach.

While many existing services enable enterprises to employ the wisdom of crowd, there is no existing practice defined for integration of crowdsourcing with the business processes. We propose PeopleCloud, as the (1) mechanism to enable access to scalable workforce on-line, connecting it to the enterprise and (2) an interface to services required for crowdsourcing tasks. We define requirements for PeopleCloud, based on our experiences in employing wisdom of crowd to source business and IT information within the enterprise.

Since the largest source of variation in a Cranfield-style experiment comes from the topics, this is a reasonable approach. However, as topic set sizes grow, and researchers look to crowdsourcing and Amazon's Mechanical Turk to collect relevance judgments, we are faced with issues of quality control. This paper examines the robustness of the TREC Million Query track methods when some assessors make significant and systematic errors. We find that while averages are robust, assessor errors can have a large effect on system rankings.

But traditional means of acquiring relevance judgments and evaluating - e.g. pooling documents to calculate average precision - do not seem to scale well to these new large collections. They require substantially more cost in human assessments for the same reliability in evaluation; if the additional cost goes over the assessing budget, errors in evaluation are inevitable. Some alternatives to pooling that support low-cost and reliable evaluation have recently been proposed. A number of them have already been used in TREC and other evaluation forums (TREC Million Query, Legal, Chemical, Web, Relevance Feedback Tracks, CLEF Patent IR, INEX). Evaluation via implicit user feedback (e.g. clicks) and crowdsourcing have also recently gained attention in the community. Thus it is important that the methodologies, the analysis they support, and their strengths and weaknesses are well-understood by the IR community. Furthermore, these approaches can support small research groups attempting to start investigating new tasks on new corpora with relatively low cost. Even groups that do not participate in TREC, CLEF, or other evaluation conferences can benefit from understanding how these methods work, how to use them, and what they mean as they build test collections for tasks they are interested in. The goal of this tutorial is to provide attendees with a comprehensive overview of techniques to perform low cost (in terms of judgment effort) evaluation. A number of topics will be covered, including alternatives to pooling, evaluation measures robust to incomplete judgments, evaluating with no relevance judgments, statistical inference of evaluation metrics, inference of relevance judgments, query selection, techniques to test the reliability of the evaluation and reusability of the constructed collections. The tutorial should be of interest to a wide range of attendees. Those new to the field will come away with a solid understanding of how low cost evaluation methods can be applied to construct inexpensive test collections and evaluate new IR technology, while those with intermediate knowledge will gain deeper insights and further understand the risks and gains of low cost evaluation. Attendees should have a basic knowledge of the traditional evaluation framework (Cranfield) and metrics (such as average precision and nDCG), along with some basic knowledge on probability theory and statistics. More advanced concepts will be explained during the tutorial.

Thomas Schelling's concept of self-command provides a potential antidote; a player compels themselves to cooperate by setting conditions that make defection costly or difficult. Successful self-command often involves enlisting a group in the enforcement of norms; brands have done so by opening themselves up to consumer feedback on blogs, but the more dramatic use of self-command occurs in the phenomenon known as crowdsourcing. In crowdsourcing, marketers solicit direct collaboration with consumers in identifying and developing brand assets, customer service features, and even products. Crowdsourcing must operate within certain rules of engagement in order to be succcessful, but it has the potential to be transformative in marketer-consumer relationships.

Yet, a lot of resources and metadata are contained in distributed and heterogeneous repositories that follow a traditional top-down approach in which only experts can contribute information. A social hub that can aggregate such information, while at the same time offering social media technologies, enables new ways to search and browse these contents, and to maintain underlying structures. We will present how the ALOE system that realises such a social backbone was integrated into the MACE portal. First evaluation results provide evidence about the usefulness of the presented approach.

For enterprises, crowdsourcing promises significant cost-savings, quicker task completion times, and formation of expert communities (both within and outside the enterprise). Many aspects of the vision of enterprise crowdsourcing are under vigorous refinement. The reasons for this lack of progress, beyond the isolated and purpose-specific crowdsourcing efforts, are manifold. In this paper, we present our experience in deploying an enterprise crowdsourcing service in the IT Inventory Management domain. We focus on the technical and sociological challenges of creating enterprise crowdsourcing service that are general-purpose, and that extend beyond mere specific-purpose, run-once prototypes. Such systems are deployed to the extent that they become an integrated part of business processes. Only when such degree of integration is achieved, the enteprises can fully adopt crowdsourcing and reap its benefits. We discuss the challenges in creating and deploying the enterprise crowdsourcing platform, and articulate current technical, governance and sociological issues towards defining a research agenda.

Changing the layout, adding/removing content or providing additional hyperlinks/widgers are examples of Web augmentation that account for a more personalized user experience. Crowdsourced Web augmentation considers end users not only the beneficiaries but also the contributors of augmentation scripts. The fundamental problem with so augmented Web applications is that code from numerous and possibly untrusted users are placed into the same security domain, hence, raising security and integrity concerns. Current solutions either coexist with the danger (e.g. Greasemonkey, where scripts work on the same security domain that the hosting application) or limit augmentation possibilities (e.g. virtual iframes in Google's Caja, where the widget is prevented from accessing the application space). This work introduces Modding Interfaces: application-specific interfaces that regulate inflow and outflow communication between the hosting code and the user code. The paper shows how the combined use of sandboxed iframes and "modding-interface" HTML5 channels ensures application integrity while permitting controlled augmentation on the hosting application.

Conversely, a lack of attention leads to a decrease in the number of videos uploaded and the consequent drop in productivity, which in many cases asymptotes to no uploads whatsoever. Moreover, short-term contributors compare their performance to the average contributor's performance while long-term contributors compare it to their own media.

But the words "solve," "explore," "understand" and "listen" have now taken on a whole new meaning. Thanks to recent technologies, including many Web 2.0 applications, companies can now tap into "the collective" on a greater scale than ever before. Indeed, the increasing use of information markets, wikis, crowdsourcing, "the wisdom of crowds" concepts, social networks, collaborative software and other Web-based tools constitutes a paradigm shift in the way that many companies make decisions. Call it the emerging era of "Decisions 2.0." But the proliferation of such technologies necessitates a framework for understanding what type of collective intelligence is possible (or not), desirable (or not) and affordable (or not) - and under what conditions. At a minimum, managers need to consider the following key issues: loss of control, diversity versus expertise, engagement, policing, intellectual property and mechanism design. By understanding such important issues, companies like Affinnova, Google, InnoCentive, Marketocracy and Threadless have successfully implemented Decisions 2.0 applications for a variety of purposes, including research and development, market research, customer service and knowledge management. The bottom line is this: For many problems that a company faces, there could well be a solution out there somewhere, far outside of the traditional places that managers might search, within or outside the organization. The trick, though, is to develop the right tool for locating that source and then tap into it.	Icosyst Corp, Cambridge, MA USA	Bonabeau, E (reprint author), Icosyst Corp, Cambridge, MA USA.

The authors begin with GMapCreator that lets users fashion new maps using Google Maps as a base. The authors then describe MapTube that enables users to archive maps and demonstrate how it can be used in a variety of contexts to share map information, to put existing maps into a form that can be shared, and to create new maps from the bottom-up using a combination of crowdcasting, crowdsourcing, and traditional broadcasting. The authors conclude by arguing that such tools are helping to define a neogeography that is essentially "mapping for the masses,'' while noting that there are many issues of quality, accuracy, copyright, and trust that will influence the impact of these tools on map-based communication.

The major question for both research and business is how to find and lever the enormous potential of the 'collective brain' to broaden the scope of 'open R&D'. Based on a literature review in the fields of Community Building and Innovation Management, this work develops an integrated framework called 'Community Engineering for Innovations'. This framework is evaluated in an Action Research project - the case of an ideas competition for an ERP Software company. The case 'SAPiens' includes the design, implementation and evaluation of an IT-supported ideas competition within the SAP University Competence Center (UCC) User Group. This group consists of approximately 60,000 people (lecturers and students) using SAP Software for educational purposes. The current challenges are twofold: on the one hand, there is not much activity yet in this community. On the other, SAP has not attempted to systematically address this highly educated group for idea generation or innovation development so far. Therefore, the objective of this research is to develop a framework for a community-based innovation development that generates innovations, process and product ideas in general and for SAP Research, in particular, combining the concepts of idea competitions and virtual communities. Furthermore, the concept aims at providing an interface to SAP Human Resources processes in order to identify the most promising students in this virtual community. This paper is the first to present an integrated concept for IT-supported idea competitions in virtual communities for leveraging the potential of crowds that is evaluated in a real-world setting.

Tools such as Google Earth offer enormous potential for land cover validation. With an ever increasing amount of very fine spatial resolution images (up to 50 cm x 50 cm) available on Google Earth, it is becoming possible for every Internet user (including non remote sensing experts) to distinguish land cover features with a high degree of reliability. Such an approach is inexpensive and allows Internet users from any region of the world to get involved in this global validation exercise. The Geo-Wiki Project is a global network of volunteers who wish to help improve the quality of global land cover maps. Since large differences occur between existing global land cover maps, current ecosystem and land-use science lacks crucial accurate data (e.g., to determine the potential of additional agricultural land available to grow crops in Africa), volunteers are asked to review hotspot maps of global land cover disagreement and determine, based on what they actually see in Google Earth and their local knowledge, if the land cover maps are correct or incorrect. Their input is recorded in a database, along with uploaded photos, to be used in the future for the creation of a new and improved hybrid global land cover map.

CROWDSOURCING THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PROCESS FOR PLANNING PROJECTS	PLANNING THEORY			English	Article						collective intelligence; crowdsourcing; public participation; urban planning; Web	CITIZEN PARTICIPATION; LOCAL KNOWLEDGE; MANAGEMENT; INFORMATION; DEMOCRACY; QUALITY; POLICY; PLANS	Public involvement is a central concern for urban planners, but the challenge for planners is how best to implement such programs, given many difficulties inherent in the typical public involvement process. The medium of the Web enables us to harness collective intellect among a population in ways face-to-face planning meetings cannot. This article argues that the crowdsourcing model, a successful, Web-based, distributed problem solving and production model for business, is an appropriate model for enabling the citizen participation process in public planning projects. This article begins with an exploration of the challenges of public participation in urban planning projects, particularly in the harnessing of creative solutions. An explanation of the theories of collective intelligence and crowd wisdom follows, arguing for the medium of the Web as an appropriate technology for harnessing far-flung genius. An exploration of crowdsourcing in a hypothetical neighborhood planning example, along with a consideration of the challenges of implementing crowdsourcing, concludes the article.

Active participation of potential lead users is the key to success. Yet a look at existing ideas competitions in the software field leads to the conclusion that many information technology (IT)-based ideas competitions fail to meet requirements upon which active participation is established. The paper describes how activation-enabling functionalities can be systematically designed and implemented in an IT-based ideas competition for enterprise resource planning software. We proceeded to evaluate the outcomes of these design measures and found that participation can be supported using a two-step model. The components of the model support incentives and motives of users. Incentives and motives of the users then support the process of activation and consequently participation throughout the ideas competition. This contributes to the successful implementation and maintenance of the ideas competition, thereby providing support for the development of promising innovative ideas. The paper concludes with a discussion of further activation-supporting components yet to be implemented and points to rich possibilities for future research in these areas.

The objective is to capture the essential features of a crowdsourcing system, an environment in which diverse tasks are presented to a large community. We aim to demonstrate the precise relationship between incentives and participation in such systems. We model contests as all-pay auctions with incomplete information; as a. consequence of revenue equivalence, our model may also be interpreted more broadly as one in Which users select among auctions of heterogeneous goods. We present two regimes in which we find an explicit correspondence in equilibrium between the offered rewards and the users' participation levels. The regimes respectively model situations in which different contests; require similar or unrelated skills. Principally, we find that rewards yield logarithmically diminishing returns with respect to participation levels. We compare these results to empirical data from the crowdsourcing site Tasken.com; we find that as we condition the data on more experienced users, the model more closely conforms to the empirical data.

There arose big research interests in social, legal issues resulted from HFS, however, very little work has been conducted to understand how it comes into being and how it dynamically evolves. This paper proposes a modeling and simulation approach incorporating network expansion and GOSSIP propagation with feedback for a better understanding of the human flesh search phenomenon. Based on the acquisition and analysis of the netizens' surfing behavior data, the evolution of the HFS Is modeled as a network growth process with proper dynamic input, which is characterized by heavy-tail and burst-oriented distribution, modeling as a Weibulloid process. Then, an improved GOSSIP model with feedback is proposed to represent the information propagation, processing and aggregation during the HFS. New insights for HFS are gained through a set of simulation experiments.

Enterprises are increasingly employing crowdsourcing to access scalable workforce on-line. In parallel, cloud computing has emerged as a new paradigm for delivering computational services, which seamlessly, interweave physical and digital worlds through a common infrastructure. This paper presents a sample crowdsourcing scenario in software development domain to derive the requirements for delivering a general-purpose crowdsourcing set-vice in the Cloud. It proposes taxonomy for categorization of crowdsourcing platforms, and evaluates a number of existing systems against the set Of identified features. Finally, the paper outlines a research agenda for enhancing crowdsourcing capabilities, with focus on virtual team building and task-based set-vice provisioning, whose lack has been a barrier to the realization of a peer-production model that engages providers from around the world.			maja@us.ibm.com					BOBROW DG, 2002, J SOC ORG LEARNING M, V4; Brabahan D., 2008, INT J RES NEW MEDIA, V14, P75, DOI DOI 10.1177/1354856507084420; Delic K.

The encyclopedic knowledge it accumulated over the years is so large that one often uses search engines, to find information in it. In contrast to regular Web pages, Wikipedia is fairly structured, and articles are usually accompanied with history pages, categories and talk pages. The meta-data available in these pages can be analyzed to gain a better understanding of the content and quality of the articles. We discuss how the rich meta-data available in wiki pages can be used to provide better search results in Wikipedia. Built on the studies on "Wisdom of Crowd" and the effectiveness of the knowledge collected by a large number of people, we investigate the effect of incorporating the extent of review of an article in the quality of rankings of the search results. The extent of review is measured by the number of distinct editors contributed to the articles and is extracted by processing Wikipedia's history pages. We compare different ranking algorithms that explore combinations of text-relevancy, PageRank, and extent of review. The results show that the review-based ranking algorithm which combines the extent of review and text-relevancy outperforms the rest; it is more accurate and less computationally expensive compared to PageRank-based rankings.

Since today's organizations expect every employee to think and act like an entrepreneur, i.e., like a manager, BPM is also increasingly becoming part of everyday operations. But merely adopting a process-based approach across the enterprise is not enough to enable BPM at every level. What is needed is a combination of organizational forms and technologies that support distributed BPM initiatives while simultaneously consolidating them company-wide. Every employee must be empowered to model and optimize their own processes. At the same time, the entire BPM community needs a platform that brings together all the individual initiatives. This is the only way to leverage the full potential of process-oriented management. In the following article, the authors describe the trends in BPM development that are turning users into process managers and supporting the creation of a BPM community.

From one simple request, submitted to the MTurk system as a 'HIT' or Human Intelligence Task, workers create their version of "a sheep facing to the left" using simple drawing tools. The artist responsible for each drawing receives a payment of two cents for their labor. The inspiration for The Sheep Market project stems from the urge to cast a light on the human role of creativity expressed by workers in the system, while explicitly calling attention to the massive and insignificant role each plays as part of a whole. The project will be presented at the Creativity and Cognition Conference as a large projection of each sheep's animated creation process as drawn by the original artist.

And what design C principles might enable these federated online systems to be more effective? This. paper reports on a qualitative study of work and task practices on Wikipedia. Despite the availability of tag-based community-wide task assignment mechanisms, informants reported that self-directed goals, within-topic expertise, and fortuitous discovery are more frequently used than community-tagged tasks. We examine how Wikipedia editors organize their actions and the actions of other participants, and what implications this has for understanding. and building tools for, crowd-powered systems, or any web site where the main force of production comes from a crowd of online participants. From these observations and insights, we developed WikiTasks, a tool that integrates with Wikipedia and supports both grassroots creation of site-wide tasks and self-selection of personal tasks, accepted from this larger pool of community tasks.

While problem management has been mostly, reactive, recent work is studying how to leverage large problem ticket information from similar IT infrastructures to probatively, predict the onset of problems. Because of the sheer size and complexity, of problem tickets, supervised learning algorithms have been the method of choice for problem ticket classification, relying on labeled (or pre-classified) tickets from one managed in frastructure to automatically, create signatures for similar infrastructures. However, where there are insufficient pre-classified data, leveraging human expertise to develop classification rules can be more efficient. In this paper, we describe a rule-based crowdsourcing approach, where experts can author classification rules and a social networking-based platform (called xPad) is used to socialize and execute these rules by, large practitioner communities. Using real data sets from several large IT delivery, centers, we demonstrate that this approach balances between two key, criteria: accuracy, and cost effectiveness.

The system is intended to allow a "crowdsourcing" approach, in which large groups perform the work more commonly by individuals. User tests are conducted with an initial implementation, with the system configured in control and "parliamentary" modes. This experiment is done in the setting of a mechanical engineering senior capstone design course. The parliamentary mode is intended to encourage discussion and negotiation among participants, and allows them to design their own work processes. Review of the designs produced together with responses to a survey indicate the system was favorably received, and allowed a group to generate and select concept designs. Future research directions are suggested.

Besides failures in detecting fraudsters, the currently employed methods yield many false positives: bona fide sellers that end up harassed by the auction site as suspects. We advocate the use of human computation (also called crowdsourcing) to improve precision and recall of current fraud detection techniques. To examine the feasibility of our proposal. we did a pilot study with it set of human subjects, testing whether they could distinguish fraudsters from common sellers before negative feedback arrived and looking just at a snapshot of seller profiles. Here we present the methodology used and the obtained results, in terms of precision and recall of human classifiers, showing positive evidence that detecting fraudsters with human computation is viable.

Crowdsourcing and service delivery	IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article								Today, service delivery organizations operate in a highly dynamic, complex, competitive, and globally distributed environment. There is constant pressure to reduce costs and improve performance and quality. Success demands the ability to continuously learn and adapt. Standardization is recognized as essential to reducing variation and, therefore, costs, as well as managing quality. Public frameworks and standards, such as ITIL (R) (Information Technology Infrastructure Library), provide best-practice guidance and a common vocabulary for managing IT (information technology) services. In this paper, we explore the role that social networking and "crowdsourcing" can play in socializing and developing best practices for a service delivery organization. We draw on our experience developing and deploying a social networking application, called Cyano, which is being used by approximately 13,000 IT professionals to capture and maintain day-to-day activities, processes, and artifacts used for problem and change management of several hundred outsourced infrastructures. Cyano is a new breed of social networking enterprise applications, in which crowdsourcing is leveraged to enrich and maintain IT processes and social networks are not created by explicit membership, but rather are implicitly discovered by the type of activities and infrastructure elements that various users support. In this paper, we focus on 1) the architecture of Cyano for supporting social tagging and linkage across different layers of management applications, 2) process customization and governance, and 3) an automated recommendation system that has been well received by thousands of IT professionals. We also highlight research challenges in this space.	[Jamjoom, H.; Qu, H.; Buco, M.

For instance, in a participatory simulation of an ecosystem, fifty participants might each control the intake and output of one agent, such that the food web emerges from the interactions of the human-controlled agents. We argue that participatory simulation has been under-utilized outside of strictly educational contexts, and that it provides myriad benefits to designers of traditional agent-based simulations. These benefits include increased robustness of the model, increased comprehensibility of the findings, and simpler design of individual agent behaviors. To make this argument, we look to recent research such as that from crowdsourcing (von Ahn, 2005) and the reinforcement learning of autonomous agent behavior (Abbeel, 2008).

In contrast to traditional user research studies that include small numbers of in-depth ethnographies, emergent design aims to access the same quality of rich insights by acquiring small pieces of qualitative information from millions of people around the world, synthesizing responses, and deriving design inspiration from emergent properties of the collective. This paper presents the concept of emergence as it relates to design, the new class of design problem that inspired the development of this toolset, and its major components, methodologies, and an initial pilot project.

This point implies to manage not only product/process data to follow design system evolution but also to foster interactions and control the collaboration among the different stakeholders involved in the different design projects. In this paper, we define the performance indicators which are impacting the performance of the design projects. They are changing all the time and provide an evolutionary vision of the system. They could be identified in the system or during the upstream or downstream phases of the product lifecycle. Especially we focus here on the performance indicators of the downstream phases (utilization, maintenance, recycling). We propose the UML approach (for Usage Lifecycle Management) to manage product information related to product usage context. This approach is supported by an external platform collecting and valorizing usage information from the different stakeholders such as customer, retailer or employees. This web 2.0 platform is developed with a crowdsourcing approach to collect information in a multi-users, multi-products and multi-companies network.			e.chapotot@estia.fr					Boztepe S, 2007, DES STUD, V28, P513, DOI 10.1016/j.destud.2007.02.010; Chang DR, 2008, J BUS RES, V61, P13, DOI 10.1016/j.jbusres.2006.05.005; Chen C-J, 2008, MEDIATING ROLE KNOWL, DOI [10.1016/j.jbusres.2007.11.016, DOI 10.1016/J.JBUSRES.2007.11.016]; Chen HH, 2008, COMPUT IND, V59, P242, DOI 10.1016/j.compind.2007.06.020; Girard P, 2006, COMPUT IND, V57, P817, DOI 10.1016/j.compind.2006.04.016; Gonnet S, 2007, EXPERT SYST APPL, V33, P881, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2006.07.004; Hicks BJ, 2002, INT J INFORM MANAGE, V22, P263, DOI 10.1016/S0268-4012(02)00012-9; Howe Jeff, 2006, WIRED, V14; Green W.S., 1999, HUMAN FACTORS PRODUC; Lederberg J, 1990, EXCITEMENT FASCINA 1, VIII; Legardeur J., 2007, J DESIGN RES, V6, P1; ODONNELL FJO, 1999, INT C ENG DES ICED 9; Patanakul P., 2008, J HIGH TECHNOLOGY MA, V18, P118, DOI DOI 10.1016/J.HITECH.2007.12.006; Pierrault J, 1989, ESSAI MACHINES COMMU; Quarante D., 1994, ELEMENTS DESIGN IND; Robin V., 2007, COMPLEX SYSTEMS CONC; Robin V, 2007, COMPUT IND, V58, P188, DOI 10.1016/j.compind.2006.09.006; Saaksvuori A., 2004, PRODUCT LIFECYCLE MA; Sagot J.C., 1998, INT J DESIGN INNOVAT, V1, P22; B Soudoplatoff, 2006, WEB 2 0; Sperandio S., 2007, P INT C ENG DES ICED; Sudarsan R, 2005, COMPUT AIDED DESIGN, V37, P1399, DOI 10.1016/j.cad.2005.02.010; Sudarsan R., 2007, COMPUT AIDED DESIGN, DOI [10.1016/j.cad.2007.06.012, DOI 10.1016/J.CAD.2007.06.012]; Tarondeau J.C., 1993, STRATEGIE IND; Vallette T, 2005, THESIS ECOLE NATL SU; Yang HL, 2008, TECHNOL FORECAST SOC, V75, P1128, DOI 10.1016/j.techfore.2007.11.008	26	0	0	0	3	DESIGN SOC	GLASGOW	UNIV STRATHCLYDE, DMEM, 75 MONTROSE ST, GLASGOW, GI 1XJ, ENGLAND			978-1-904670-07-0				2009							297	308				12	Engineering, Manufacturing; Management; Operations Research & Management Science	Engineering; Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science	BZS25	WOS:000302734700026		No			2017-07-02	S	Ramos, I; Cardoso, M; Carvalho, JV; Graca, JI		Dhillon, G; Stahl, BC; Baskerville, R		Ramos, Isabel; Cardoso, Margarida; Carvalho, Joao Vidal; Graca, Jose Ismael			An Action Research on Open Knowledge and Technology Transfer	INFORMATION SYSTEMS - CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION IN SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES	IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	IFIP Conference on the Role of IS in Leveraging the Intelligence and Creativity of SMEs (CreativeSME 2009)	JUN 21-24, 2009	Univ Minho, Guimaraes, PORTUGAL	IFIP WG 8 2	Univ Minho		OPEN INNOVATION; NETWORKS; PERSPECTIVE; FIRMS	R&D has always been considered a strategic asset of companies. Traditionally, companies that have their own R&D function are better prepared to compete in the globalized economy because they are able to produce the knowledge and technology required to advance products and services. SMEs also need to become highly innovative and competitive in order to be successful. Nevertheless, their ability to have an internal R&D function that effectively meets their innovation needs is usually very weak. Open innovation provides access to a vast amount of new ideas and technologies at lower costs than closed innovation. This paper presents an action research study being carried out at University of Minho to develop a business model and technology platform for an innovation brokering service connecting ideas and technologies being developed at Universities with the specific innovation needs of SMEs. The expected contributions of the study include the empirical investigation of the effectiveness and risks of crowdsourcing innovation when applied in the socioeconomic context of a European developing country where SMEs represent 99,6% of the businesses.

The Spectral Game: leveraging Open Data and crowdsourcing for education	JOURNAL OF CHEMINFORMATICS			English	Article								We report on the implementation of the Spectral Game, a web-based game where players try to match molecules to various forms of interactive spectra including 1D/2D NMR, Mass Spectrometry and Infrared spectra. Each correct selection earns the player one point and play continues until the player supplies an incorrect answer. The game is usually played using a web browser interface, although a version has been developed in the virtual 3D environment of Second Life. Spectra uploaded as Open Data to ChemSpider in JCAMP-DX format are used for the problem sets together with structures extracted from the website. The spectra are displayed using JSpecView, an Open Source spectrum viewing applet which affords zooming and integration. The application of the game to the teaching of proton NMR spectroscopy in an undergraduate organic chemistry class and a 2D Spectrum Viewer are also presented.

Recent studies of innovation have pointed to the growing relevance of external sources of innovation and the firm's necessity of involving a wide range of internal and external actors and sources to help achieving and sustaining its business strategy. The company can become more innovative by implementing a process of cocreation. It can do this in two ways (1) by internally identifying the business problems and needs for innovation felt by individuals, teams and organizational units (seekers) and furthering the emergence of a community of specialists (within or outside the organization), or employees motivated to provide their knowledge and skills to address innovation problems, increasing their internal visibility and ensuring their empowerment across the company (solvers); (2) by placing its innovation problems and needs to a brokering service that can find the right people to present solutions. These two forms of open innovation is called Crowdsourcing Innovation. Innovation brings risks. Risk of Financial loss or of being unsuccessful. If innovation requires business or organizational change, the risk is even bigger because innovation implies newness and unknown. Any company that innovates must face the inherent risks. Facing the risks requires that the company manages them, understanding in advance their nature and impact, monitoring the relevant indicators to anticipate their occurrence, and being ready to act immediately at the first signs of trouble. The innovating company should consider managing risks as one of its core competences. Without this capability, any innovation project can become an opportunity to dramatically fail the business objectives and sustainability. Steady progress has been made over the last years in understanding open innovation strategy. This paper adds to that effort by focusing a specific form of open innovation - crowdsourcing innovation - and describing an action research in progress to develop a method to identify the risks involved and to manage them in technology-based companies.

Crowdsourcing has enormous potential that can be truly unleashed when extended to sensor-rich mobile devices, such as smart phones. In this paper, we demonstrate mCrowd, an iPhone based mobile crowdsourcing platform that enables mobile users to post and work on sensor-related crowdsourcing tasks. mCrowd enables mobile users to fully utilize the rich sensors equipped with iPhone to participate and accomplish crowdsourcing tasks at fingertips, including geolocation-aware image collection, image tagging, road traffic monitoring, and others.

Respective business activities are however difficult to manage. Traditional approaches of covering human tasks in business processes build on assumptions of limited process scale and closed organizational models that are not valid in crowdsourcing scenarios. Web services have been proposed as a means to represent human tasks that allow leveraging interaction, brokerage and composition capabilities of SOC for human interaction management. In this paper we argue that crowdsourcing requires considering qualitative constraints and sketch a platform for managing the quality of human-based eServices.

Building on previous research on information systems outsourcing, a theoretical framework for exploring the opensourcing phenomenon is derived. The first phase of the research concerned qualitative case studies involving three commercial organizations (IONA Technologies, Philips Medical Systems, and Telefonica) that had "liberated" what had hitherto been proprietary software and sought to grow a global open source community around their product We followed this with a large-scale survey in volving additional exemplars of the phenomenon. The study identifies a number of symmetrical and complementary customer and community obligations that are associated with opensourcing success. We also identify a number of tension points on which customer and community perceptions tend to vary. Overall the key watchwords for opensourcing are openness, trust, tact, professionalism, transparency, and complementariness: The customer and community need to establish a trusted partnership of shared responsibility in building an overall opensourcing ecosystem. The study reveals an ongoing shift from OSS as a community of individual developers to OSS as a community of commercial organizations, primarily small to medium-sized enterprises. It also reveals that opensourcing provides ample opportunity for companies to headhunt top developers, hence moving from outsourcing to a largely unknown OSS workforce toward recruitment of developers from a global open source community whose talents have become known as a result of the opensourcing experience.

Social networks like MySpace or Facebook and media sites like Flickr or YouTube clearly demonstrate the variety and functionality of social sites. Significantly affected by this trend, online retail and e-commerce environments rapidly changed within the last years. Users were integrated into existing e-shops and mutated from simple buyers to fully integrated customers. Thus, a modem shop visitor can recommend products, leave comments, rate vendors or publish wish lists. This recent phenomenon, called social commerce or social shopping, leads to more customer satisfaction, user participation and social interaction. Accordingly, there is a strong demand for innovative social commerce models and concepts like crowdsourcing, consumer generated content or live shopping. This paper shows the results of an extended analysis of collaborative shopping networks and demonstrates the development of a representative interaction model. An evaluation of social commerce models gave insights into functionalities, interactions and entities of successful social web applications. To create a collaborative shopping network model, conventional web services as well as selected best practice cases were analyzed in detail. To meet the demands of modern consumers, success factors are presented in the final part.

However, the costs involved in engaging users often requires practitioners to trade off between sample size, time requirements, and monetary costs. Micro-task markets, such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk, offer a potential paradigm for engaging a large number of users for low time and monetary costs. Here we investigate the utility of a micro-task market for collecting user measurements, and discuss design considerations for developing remote micro user evaluation tasks. Although micro-task markets have great potential for rapidly collecting user measurements at low costs, we found that special care is needed in formulating tasks in order to harness the capabilities of the approach.

In a Witkey site, users offer a small award for a solution to a task, and other users compete to have their solution selected. In this paper, we examine the behavior of users on one of the biggest Witkey websites in China, Taskcn.com. On Taskcn, we observed several characteristics in users' activity over time. Most users become inactive after only a few submissions. Others keep attempting tasks. Over time, users tend to select tasks where they are competing against fewer opponents to increase their chances of winning. They will also, perhaps counterproductively, select tasks with higher expected rewards. Yet, on average, they do not increase their chances of winning, and in some categories of tasks, their chances actually decrease. This does not paint the full picture, however, because there is a very small core of successful users who manage not only to win multiple tasks, but to increase their win-to-submission ratio over time. This core group proposes nearly 20% of the winning solutions on the site. The patterns we observe on Taskcn, we believe, hold clues to the future of crowdsourcing and freelance marketplaces, and raise interesting design implications for such sites.
